Created by: Amish Trivedi | Last Updated Date: 29-Jan-2020

## Overview:
[Chart. js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is a JavaScript library that allows you to draw different types of charts by using the HTML5 canvas element.<br/>
To show you how dynamically it works, I have used PHP and MySQL database.

## Installation

* Download and extract the files from the diary_application repository to your system.
* Install the local server environment [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).  
* Copy the downloaded folder to C:\MAMP\htdocs directory.
